# Cris Cross

Cris Cross is a project that aims to provide Cross Platform SDKs for the Azure Custom Speech Service. 

It will comprise of:

* A C# Nuget Package to call the Custom Speech API from any C# application including xamarin.
* An Azure Function workflow for dealing with large file processing with CRIS (see Functions)
* An NPM package which allows you to simply call the CRIS endpoints without modifying the Bing Speech SDK.
